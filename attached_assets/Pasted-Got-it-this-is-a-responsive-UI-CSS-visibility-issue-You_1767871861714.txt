Got it 👍 — this is a responsive UI / CSS visibility issue.

You are seeing:

👉 Edit button appears in mobile view
👉 Edit button does NOT appear in laptop / desktop view

This means the button is being hidden by CSS for larger screen sizes.

Here is a developer-friendly explanation + fix you can directly give to your tech team.

🐞 Issue: Edit Button Hidden on Desktop, Visible on Mobile
❌ Current Behavior

On mobile → Edit button is visible

On laptop / desktop → Edit button is missing

This is due to responsive CSS rules or conditional rendering based on screen width.

✅ Expected Behavior

The Edit button should be:
✔ Visible on both mobile and desktop
✔ Same functionality across devices

🔍 Most Likely Cause
1️⃣ CSS Media Query Hiding Desktop View

Your CSS may contain something like:

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .edit-btn {
    display: none;
  }
}


OR

.hidden-desktop {
  display: none;
}

2️⃣ Conditional Rendering in Frontend

In React / Vue / JS, something like:

{isMobile && <EditButton />}


So on desktop:

isMobile = false → Edit button not rendered

🛠 Fix – Make Edit Button Visible on All Screens
✅ CSS Fix

Ensure the button is not hidden in desktop styles:

.edit-btn {
  display: inline-flex;
}


Remove or override any rule like:

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .edit-btn {
    display: none;
  }
}

✅ React / JS Fix

Instead of:

{isMobile && <EditButton />}


Use:

<EditButton />


OR if different layouts are needed:

{(isMobile || isDesktop) && <EditButton />}

📱 UI Requirement (Clear for Dev Team)
Edit Button Visibility

Mobile: Show Edit button

Desktop / Laptop: Show Edit button

Do NOT hide based on screen size

🧪 Expected Result
Device	Edit Button
Mobile	✅ Visible
Laptop / Desktop	✅ Visible
🧑‍💻 Developer Checklist

✔ Search for .edit, .edit-btn, or similar classes in CSS
✔ Check @media queries that hide elements
✔ Check frontend conditions like isMobile, window.innerWidth, or breakpoints
✔ Remove size-based hiding
✔ Test on:

Mobile

Tablet

Laptop

Desktop

🔒 Optional Enhancement (If Layout Was the Reason)

If the button was hidden to avoid UI clutter on desktop, instead:

Move Edit into Actions column

Or show it as an icon button (✏️)

But do not remove functionality.
