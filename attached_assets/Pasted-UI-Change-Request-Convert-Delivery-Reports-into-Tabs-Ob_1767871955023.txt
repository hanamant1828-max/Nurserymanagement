UI Change Request – Convert Delivery Reports into Tabs
🎯 Objective

Currently, the following reports are displayed one below another:

Variety-wise Delivery Report

Village-wise Delivery Report

Category-wise Delivery Report

You want them to be:
✔ Shown as separate tabs
✔ Only one report visible at a time
✔ These tabs should appear first in the Reports page

❌ Current Layout (Problem)

All reports are rendered together in vertical sections:

[ Variety-wise Report ]
[ Village-wise Report ]
[ Category-wise Report ]


This makes the page long and harder to navigate.

✅ Expected Layout (Tabbed View)

At the top of the Reports section, show tabs:

[ Variety-wise ]   [ Village-wise ]   [ Category-wise ]


Only the active tab’s report should be displayed.

🧭 Default Behavior

On page load:

Active Tab = Variety-wise


Clicking on a tab:

Hides the other two reports

Shows only the selected report

🖥 UI Behavior
Tabs (Top Section)

Variety-wise

Village-wise

Category-wise

Content Area

Shows only one report table at a time based on the selected tab.

🔄 Functional Logic
Tab Switching (Frontend)
selectedTab = 'VARIETY' | 'VILLAGE' | 'CATEGORY'


Render conditionally:

If selectedTab == 'VARIETY'  → Show Variety-wise report
If selectedTab == 'VILLAGE'  → Show Village-wise report
If selectedTab == 'CATEGORY' → Show Category-wise report

📑 Export Buttons

Each tab should still contain:

Download PDF

Export Excel

And they should export only the currently active report.

🧪 Example Flow

1️⃣ User opens Reports page
→ Variety-wise tab is active
→ Variety report table is visible

2️⃣ User clicks Village-wise
→ Variety report hidden
→ Village-wise report displayed

3️⃣ User clicks Category-wise
→ Only category report shown

🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

✔ Do not render all three reports at once
✔ Use tab state / routing / conditional rendering
✔ Keep filters (date range, search) working across all tabs
✔ Maintain existing backend logic (only UI structure changes)

📌 Optional Enhancement

Later, you can:

Add summary cards above tabs (Total Orders, Total Quantity, Revenue)

Remember last selected tab in session
