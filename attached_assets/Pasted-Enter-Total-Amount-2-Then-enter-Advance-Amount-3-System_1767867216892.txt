Enter Total Amount
2️⃣ Then enter Advance Amount
3️⃣ System calculates Remaining Balance

That logic is perfectly valid for order booking.

But let me explain how to make it clearer, safer, and more user-friendly.

✅ Your Current Payment Flow (Correct)

You are doing:

Total Amount → entered by user

Advance (₹) → entered by user

Remaining Balance → auto calculated

💡 This is commonly used in nurseries, agriculture orders, and advance booking systems.

So yes, the user should:
👉 First enter Total Amount
👉 Then enter Advance Amount

⚠️ Small Improvements You Should Add

To avoid mistakes and wrong entries, add these validations:

1️⃣ Prevent Advance > Total Amount

Advance should never be greater than Total Amount.

✔ Validation rule:

Advance ≤ Total Amount


If not:

“Advance cannot be greater than total amount.”

2️⃣ Auto-Calculate Remaining Balance

You should not allow manual editing of Remaining Balance.

Formula:

Remaining Balance = Total Amount - Advance


This prevents accounting errors.

3️⃣ Show Payment Status Automatically

Based on Advance:

Advance	Remaining	Payment Status
0	Full	Pending
Partial	Balance > 0	Partially Paid
Equal to Total	0	Fully Paid

You can store:

payment_status = Pending / Partial / Paid

🧩 Optional (Better UX)

If later you want to make it smarter:

Instead of asking for Total Amount manually, you can calculate it from:

Total Amount = Quantity × Price per Unit


But since you already have a Total Amount field, your current method is completely fine.

🧾 Final Confirmation

✔ Yes — User should:

Enter Total Amount

Then enter Advance Amount

System calculates Remaining Balance

✔ Just make sure:

Remaining balance is read-only

Advance cannot be more than total

Payment status is auto-updated

If you want, next I can:
👉 Write exact validation logic (C#, Java, or Python/Flask)
👉 Or suggest UI text/labels to make this clearer for your users (like “Enter Total Bill Amount first, then advance”).

Here is a clear, developer-friendly requirement / prompt you can directly give to your tech team 👇

🔧 Payment Fields Logic – Developer Requirements

Context:
This is the Order Booking form in the Nursery Management System.

The form contains:

Total Amount

Advance Amount

Remaining Balance (auto-calculated)

✅ Functional Requirements
1️⃣ Field Entry Order

User must first enter Total Amount.

After that, user can enter Advance Amount.

Remaining Balance must be calculated automatically.

2️⃣ Calculation Logic
RemainingBalance = TotalAmount - AdvanceAmount


Remaining Balance should be read-only (not editable by user).

3️⃣ Validation Rules
✔ Advance Amount Validation

Advance must not be greater than Total Amount.

If (AdvanceAmount > TotalAmount)
    Show error: "Advance cannot be greater than Total Amount"
    Disable Confirm Order button

✔ Negative / Empty Values

Total Amount and Advance Amount must not be negative.

Total Amount is mandatory.

Advance Amount can be 0.

4️⃣ Payment Status (System Field)

System should automatically set Payment Status based on values:

If (AdvanceAmount == 0)
    PaymentStatus = "Pending"

Else If (AdvanceAmount > 0 AND AdvanceAmount < TotalAmount)
    PaymentStatus = "Partially Paid"

Else If (AdvanceAmount == TotalAmount)
    PaymentStatus = "Paid"


This field is not editable by user.

5️⃣ UI / UX Behavior

Remaining Balance should update in real-time when:

Total Amount changes

Advance Amount changes

Disable Confirm Order button if:

Total Amount is empty

Advance > Total

Any required field is invalid

🧪 Example Scenarios
Total	Advance	Remaining	Status
1000	0	1000	Pending
1000	300	700	Partially Paid
1000	1000	0	Paid
1000	1200	❌ Error	Invalid
🗂 Suggested Database Fields
total_amount      DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
advance_amount    DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0
remaining_balance DECIMAL(10,2)
payment_status    VARCHAR(20)

🧠 Optional Enhancement (Future)

If pricing logic is added later:

TotalAmount = Quantity × PricePerUnit


Until then, Total Amount will be entered manually by the user.
