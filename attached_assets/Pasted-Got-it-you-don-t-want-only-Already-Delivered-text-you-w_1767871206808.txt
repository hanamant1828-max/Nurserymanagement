Got it 👍 — you **don’t want only “Already Delivered” text**, you want an **UNDO option** so the user can revert the order back from *Delivered*.

Here is a clean **developer-friendly requirement** you can directly give to your tech team:

---

## 🔁 Feature: Undo Delivered (Revert Order Status)

### 🎯 Objective

When an order is marked as **Delivered**, the system should:
✔ Keep the order visible
✔ Show an **Undo option** instead of only “Already Delivered”
✔ Allow reverting the status back to **Booked / Pending**

---

## ❌ Current Behavior

* Order status becomes: `Delivered`
* Card shows only: **“Already Delivered”**
* User **cannot revert** the action

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### 1️⃣ UI Behavior

When order status = `Delivered`:

Instead of:

```
Already Delivered
```

Show:

```
[ ✔ Delivered ]   [ Undo ]
```

OR

```
Undo Delivery
```

---

### 2️⃣ Undo Action Logic

When user clicks **Undo**:

✔ Order status should change from:

```
Delivered → Booked
```

(or `Pending`, based on your business logic)

✔ Order should:

* Remain visible in the Orders list
* Show the original action button again:

```
[ Mark Delivered ]
```

---

## 🔄 Backend Logic

### Mark Delivered

```sql
UPDATE Orders
SET status = 'Delivered'
WHERE order_id = @OrderId;
```

### Undo Delivered

```sql
UPDATE Orders
SET status = 'Booked'
WHERE order_id = @OrderId;
```

🚫 Do NOT delete the order
🚫 Do NOT remove it from list views

---

## 🧪 Example Flow

### Before:

```
Status: Booked
Button: Mark Delivered
```

### After Clicking "Mark Delivered":

```
Status: Delivered
Button: Undo
```

### After Clicking "Undo":

```
Status: Booked
Button: Mark Delivered
```

---

## 🔒 Optional Safety (Recommended)

Add confirmation before undo:

```
"Are you sure you want to undo this delivery?"
[Yes] [Cancel]
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* **Do not hard-disable** delivered records.
* UI must be **state-driven based on order_status**.
* Undo should be available only if:

```
order_status == 'Delivered'
```

---

## 📌 Optional Enhancements

* Log status changes:

```
Delivered → Booked (Undone by User X on Date)
```

* Role-based permission:

  * Only Admin / Manager can Undo

If you want, I can also give:
👉 Exact **API endpoints** (`/mark-delivered`, `/undo-delivered`)
👉 Frontend **React / Angular / JS logic**
👉 Or SQL + C# / Java / Python backend code

Just tell me your tech stack.
