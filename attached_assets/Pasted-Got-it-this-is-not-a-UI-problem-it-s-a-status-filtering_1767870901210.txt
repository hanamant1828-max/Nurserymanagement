Got it 👍 — this is **not a UI problem**, it’s a **status + filtering logic issue**.

Right now:
👉 When you click **“Mark Delivered”**, the order is being **removed from the Orders list**
👉 But you want the order to **remain visible**, only its status should change.

Here is a **developer-friendly requirement** you can give directly to your team.

---

## 🔧 Requirement – “Mark Delivered” Should NOT Remove Order from List

### ❌ Current Behavior (Bug)

When the user clicks **Mark Delivered**:

* Order status is updated to **Delivered**
* The order **disappears from the Orders View**

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### 1️⃣ Order Must Remain in Orders View

After clicking **Mark Delivered**:

* Order should **still be visible**
* Only the **status should change** from:

```
Booked → Delivered
```

---

## 🔄 Correct Functional Logic

### Backend / Database

```
UPDATE Orders
SET status = 'Delivered'
WHERE order_id = @OrderId;
```

🚫 Do NOT delete the order
🚫 Do NOT exclude it from the main orders query

---

### Frontend / API Filtering

#### ❌ Current (Wrong – likely happening)

```
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE status != 'Delivered'
```

#### ✅ Correct (Show All Orders)

```
SELECT * FROM Orders
```

OR if filtering is required:

```
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE status IN ('Booked', 'Delivered', 'Pending')
```

---

## 🖥 UI Behavior

After clicking **Mark Delivered**:

✔ Order remains in the list
✔ Status badge updates to **“Delivered”**
✔ “Mark Delivered” button should:

* Be disabled
* OR replaced with a label like **“Delivered”**

---

## 🧪 Example

### Before Click:

```
Order ID: 101
Status: Booked
```

### After Click:

```
Order ID: 101
Status: Delivered
```

✔ Still visible in orders view
❌ Must NOT disappear

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Action Items

1. **Do not delete or hide the record**
2. Ensure the orders list query:

   * Does **not exclude Delivered orders**
3. Update only:

```
status = 'Delivered'
```

4. Update UI state after action

---

## 🗂 Optional Enhancement (If You Want Filters)

If later you want separation:

* Add filter tabs:

  * All Orders
  * Pending
  * Delivered
  * Cancelled

But **default view must show all orders**.

If you want, I can also provide:
👉 SQL query fix
👉 API response structure
👉 React / Angular / .NET / Java / Python backend logic
👉 Or convert this into a **JIRA / GitHub bug ticket**

Just tell me your tech stack.
